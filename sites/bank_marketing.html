<p class="body-text">
    In the <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing" target="blank"><b>dataset</b></a> 
    there are: <b>demographics information such as:</b> <i>age, job, marital, education;</i>
     <b>information about client financial status:</b><i> default (has person defaulted: yes, no), balance, housing, loan;</i>
     <b>and information about previous contacts:</b><i> contact, day, month, duration, campaign, pdays, previous, poutcome.</i>
     The dependant variable describes whether client has subscribed to term deposit.
<br><br>
    Of course we could perform classification model employing Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression or any other suitable model.
    <br><br>
    But there are indications that a more suitable business application of data science would be in this case clustering task. Classification algorithm would of course be useful 
    to improve efficiency and contact those clients that are the most willing to pursue an offer.
    <br><br>
    It would be very useful in the case where we want not only to minimize costs, but also to expand as a business, so we might receive the decision perform analysis for marketing team which 
    might tell us what are we missing, if there are any groups of clients that have significant lower conversion rate and if they possess distinct characteristics, or maybe some groups of clients
    reponds incredibly well and we might want to know what else can we offer them.
<br><br>
 The datebase has been checked before the analysis and there were no issues with column names nor with missing or significantly unexpected values. Below is the code for clustering and corresponding output.

<p class="body-text">The amount of clusters have been chosen by experimenting with different amounts to visualise different groups in best way possible for our
    marketing department and turned out to be 8 clusters. We performed feature engineering, since there are lots of customers who have not been contacted (pdays = -1) and some customers who have
    been contacted long ago. Therefore we will change values for those not contacted from -1 to 0 and apply logarithm transoform -> log1p (log 1 + x) to better capture underlying information.
    We also scaled continous features and encoded categorical features. The variable pdays_transf is the variable pdays_transformed.

8 clusters might seem like a lot at first, but it turns out we captured all of the important information. Lets dive into each group and see what happened there.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 1</b> is made up of slightly younger group across all clusters, showing the lowest engagement and a conversion rate of just 1.6%. These customers tend to have low balances and short call durations, with almost no previous contact. For marketing, this group does not seem to offer much value, so instead of pushing through with telemarketing, it might make sense to switch towards digital avenues like social media or influencer campaigns. If current products do not appeal to them, it might be worth thinking about developing new offerings that match what they are looking for.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 2</b> consists of slightly older customers who have a moderate conversion rate of 14.2%. They carry much higher balances and have had some previous contact, making them a more engaged audience with real financial capacity. There's definite potential here for more engagement. A smart move could be to offer products that suit their financial needs, like retirement planning or wealth management services. Direct mail campaigns or tailored offers could boost conversion even more. Since they are financially stronger, premium products might also catch their interest.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 3</b> shows moderate engagement but a solid conversion rate of 21.8%. These customers are middle-aged, have moderate balances, and have been contacted before. They are already somewhat engaged, so the focus should be on keeping them engaged and introducing products that match what already is known about them from previous interactions.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 4</b> is the best-performing group by far, with the conversion rate of 49.6%. They engage in long calls and show strong interest despite having had limited previous contact. This group is the most valuable, and we should focus on loyalty programs and perhaps referral programs to keep them involved. Upselling or cross-selling based on what they have purchased before would likely work well with this group.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 5</b> has lower engagement and a conversion rate of 8.8%. They are younger, have the lowest balances, and have short calls. Similar to Cluster 1, the focus should be on a long-term strategy, not on quick conversions through telemarketing. Over time, developing products that suit their needs could lead to better outcomes.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 6</b> has been contacted frequently but shows a low conversion rate of 2.5%. This group has likely been overexposed to our efforts, making them less receptive. It is important to cut back on the number of calls to avoid customer frustration. Offering useful information or promotions through channels like email or social media—without pushing too hard—could help rebuild trust. Further analysis of this cluster might uncover smaller sub-groups with more specific needs, giving better targeting opportunities.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 7</b> consists of customers with high balances but low engagement, converting at 7.7%. They are middle-aged, have longer call durations, but show little interest in what is currently offered. The issue here might be that the products are not matching their financial goals. A more tailored approach could help to understand what they are looking for. Premium products or services that align with their wealth could be more appealing to them. Direct mail might work better than telemarketing for this group.
    <br><br>
    <b>Cluster 8</b> has moderate engagement and a healthy conversion rate of 24.3%. They have had significant previous contact and have a strong likelihood of converting. This group represents a typical customer segment that seems to respond well to current marketing strategy. The next step would be campaign optimization—analyzing what has worked in the past to refine the messaging and increase engagement further.

For further improvements for our marketing team we could add some visualisations so that certain aspects are more visible.

We can clearly see some correlation here. We could calculate <b>Pearson's correlation</b> coefficient or <b>Spearmann correlation</b> coefficient to reduce impact of outliers and 
test the hypothesis that they are statistically significant.
But we could look at each cluster independently as well to see if there are diffrences within clusters.

These visualisations certainly would help our marketing team understand better what actions should be undertaken in order
 to increase revenue. For further refinements we could merge Cluster 1 and Cluster 5 based on similarities as well as Cluster 3 and Cluster 8. 
We could then perhaps provide more granularity for Cluster 6 to see why they have been over-contacted.
